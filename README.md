# Invincible Structures

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

It's a server protection mod.

With this mod, giants, antlion sinkhole and meteor will not be able to destroy the structures any more.

Still, the hammer can destroy them.

In addition, Fence Gate and Thulecite Wall can be invincible too.

It's better if you combine the one of these two mod [Smarter Ice Flingomatic](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845106626) or [Fireproof Structures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1842845837) with this mod.[/b]

## Changelog

**List of tweaks I made for version 1.2**

- Add more wall to be invincible, which is turned off by default.
